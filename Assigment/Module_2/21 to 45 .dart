/* 21.What is inheritance?

- the process in which one class derive the properties and characteristics of another class. 
It is helpful as it provides an ability with which we can create a new class from an existing class.*/ 

/* 22.Which inheritance is not supported by Dart? Why? B3. What is advantage of inheritance? 

- hybrid and  multiple inheritance not support in dart
- Multiple Inheritance: This inheritance occurs when a class inherits more than one parent class.
 Dart doesn't support this.
- hybrid : combination of many Inheritances
- Advantage:  code that is present in the parent class can be directly used by the child class. */


/* 23. Difference between inheritance and encapsulation. B5. Difference between inheritance and abstraction.

- Encapsulation is a mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. 
- Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class acquires the properties and methods of another class.

- abstraction allows hiding the internal details and displaying only the functionality to the users. 
- inheritance allows using properties and methods of an already existing class. */

/* 24. Difference between inheritance and polymorphism.

- Inheritance is one in which a new class is created (derived class) that inherits the features from the already existing class(Base class). 
- polymorphism is that which can be defined in multiple forms. */

/* 25. Can we override static method in Dart? */

/* 26. Can we overload static method in Dart? */

/* 27. Can a class implement more than one interface? B10. Can a class extend more than one class in Dart?
- Dart has the ability to implement several interfaces. The keyword implements allows a class to adhere to multiple interfaces.
- Dart doesn't support multiple inheritance, which means a class cannot extend more than one class. */

/* 28. Can an interface extend more than one interface in Dart?
- yes */

/* 29. What will happen if a class implements two interfaces and they both have a method with same name and signature? */
